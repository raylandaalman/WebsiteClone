# WebsiteClone

## What is this project?

This is an unauthorized clone of the website:
https://help.abstract.com/hc/en-us

The purpose of this project was to take a website and design a clone of it using only HTML and CSS to practice front-end development.

If being provided a design from Photoshop, Inkscape, Figma, or any other design tool, then a webpage can be made that matches the design.

## JavaScript

This is also the first project where I utilized JavaScript to make interactive menus. I first followed a guide to learn how to make a hamburger menu from the dev.to user Gaurav from:
https://dev.to/devggaurav/let-s-build-a-responsive-navbar-and-hamburger-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript-4gci

After I learned how to make a hamburger menu from Gaurav's article on dev.to, I then made my own interactive hamburger menu and search bar.
